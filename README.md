# Granite
A weird image up-scaling program.


## How to use
At the moment, its not a package or anything.
Download the code and install jimp (npm i jimp)
Add an image called "in.png", and run the program.
A new file will (hopefully) appear called "out.png", that has been kinda upscaled

## Can you make it a package?
I can't be bothered to make it a package, so you can try. If you do, submit a lil pull request and i'll update it (:
